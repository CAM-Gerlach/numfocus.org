Founded by the creators of NumPy, SciPy, and Chaco, Continuum offers
Python-based tools and consulting services for the analysis, management and
visualization of big data. Continuum’s premier Python distribution, Anaconda,
performs high-performance, large data analysis, including statistics, machine
learning, and distributed computing. Wakari, Continuum’s newest product, is an
online cloud-based Python analytics environment for easy sharing of code,
visualizations, IPython Notebooks, data sets and derived data products.
Cloud-hosted or installed internally, Wakari allows users to harness
Continuum’s full product set, including Anaconda and enterprise-supported
Python, from their browsers.
