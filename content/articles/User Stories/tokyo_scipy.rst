Chairman of NumFOCUS' Board of Director's, Travis Oliphant, spoke at the
March meeting of Tokyo SciPy via live webcast.  Topics he covered
included the history of \ `SciPy`_, where \ `NumPy `_\ should go next,
and Numba.  Questions were asked regarding sparse matrix integration
with NumPy, and packaging.

Tokyo SciPy member, Syoyo, gave Travis the link to his code for
simulating smoke,  `http://code.google.com/p/smoke3d/`_.  Perhaps at
some point, Syoyo will be able to make that code fast using Python.

Despite a late night, due to the fourteen hour time difference between
Austin and Tokyo, Travis spoke for over an hour.  He later stated, “…it
was nice to see that SciPy and NumPy have a user community in Japan.”
