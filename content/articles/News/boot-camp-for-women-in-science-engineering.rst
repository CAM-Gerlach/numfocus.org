Women in Science & Engineering Boot Camps
=========================================

On June 24-25 `NumFOCUS`_ and `Software Carpentry`_, are hosting a
software skills boot camp for 120 women in science and engineering at
Microsoft Research in Boston. We are seeking sponsorship from companies
and others who would like to support our efforts to hold similar boot
camps in other locations.

What is a Boot Camp?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These two-day workshops teach scientists how to write, test and manage
research software. Topics covered include the Unix shell, version
control, basic Python programming, testing, and debugging Boot camps are
example-driven and alternate short tutorials with hands-on practical
exercises. Since learners work on their own laptops, they leave with a
set of working tools they can use immediately to increase their
productivity and improve confidence in their results.

What is the Funding For?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NumFOCUS and Software Carpentry are non-profit organizations, and all of
our instructors are volunteers. Donations to the Boot Camp for Women
will cover the cost of travel and lodging for instructors, as well as
incidental expenses such as refreshments.

How Can I Contribute?
