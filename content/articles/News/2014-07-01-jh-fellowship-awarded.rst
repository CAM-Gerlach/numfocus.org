We're thrilled to announce that the `2014 John Hunter Fellowship`_ has been
awarded to **Olga Botvinnik, UC San Diego**.  The focus of her Fellowship will
be to create open source analysis software for the single-cell and biology
communities, and to pioneer data, code sharing, and computational
reproducibility within the single-cell and RNA biology communities.  She will
take up this Fellowship in the second half of 2014, and collaborate
with her academic mentor `Gene Yeo`_ and software mentor `C. Titus Brown`_. You can
read more about `Olga's work at her site.`_

The selection process was not an easy one - there were a number of high quality
applicants that we would have loved to be able to award a fellowship.
Honorable Mentions go to **Damien Irving (University of Melbourne)** 
and **Connie Gao (MIT)**. 

This first Numfocus Fellowship Program has gotten off to a promising start.
We're aiming to expand the program in the coming years to 5-10 fellowships each
year.
