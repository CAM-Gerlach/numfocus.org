Due in part to a generous donation made by J.P. Morgan to NumFOCUS, we are
pleased to announce that `NumFOCUS`_ will be collaborating with `Software Carpentry`_
to host a series of  boot camps to offer training for women in technology. The
first, a boot camp for 120 women in science and engineering, will be held at
the Microsoft Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 24-25.

About
-----
The goal of this event is to help scientists and engineers become more
productive by teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version
control, testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot camp, short
tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises.
The boot camp is open to female graduate students, post-docs, faculty members,
staff scientists, or their equivalent in science, engineering, medicine, or a
related field in academia, industry, or the public and non-profit sectors.
