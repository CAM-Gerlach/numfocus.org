`PyData NYC`_ was held in NYC at the J.P. Morgan facilities where attendees were 
treated to spectacular views of the Manhattan skyline while listening to Keynote 
talks by `Peter Wang`_ and `Brian Granger`_.   Thanks to the generous donation
of their facility by J.P. Morgan and other sponsors of the conference, 
net proceeds from PyData NYC will be able to provide resources to NumFOCUS to 
further its mission which included sponsoring over 20 diversity scholarships to the 
conference.

J.P. Morgan also made possible, through sponsorship and participation, a special 
Women in Technology event held in conjunction the conference in which more than 
60 high-school girls from around New York City were able to be instructed and 
motivated by women in technical positions at J.P. Morgan and elsewhere. 

NumFOCUS was founded, to promote this kind of collaboration between open-source
communities and companies with a need for technical computing. For information on 
how your company can support NumFOCUS and its affiliated projects, please our
