NumFOCUS and IPython_ are thrilled to announce that in August 2013, Microsoft
made a donation of $100,000 to sponsor IPython's continued development.
Microsoft and IPython have had a fruitful collaboration, dating back to 2009,
involving Microsoft's Windows HPC Server, `Python Tools for Visual Studio`_,
and an `Azure-based workflow`_.  The response from the IPython team is posted
in their announcement_.

NumFOCUS was founded, in part, to foster this type of collaboration between
open source scientific tools and companies who value this shared computational
infrastructure.  For information on how your company can support NumFOCUS and its
affiliated projects, please our `donations page`_ or contact us directly at `info@numfocus.org`_.
