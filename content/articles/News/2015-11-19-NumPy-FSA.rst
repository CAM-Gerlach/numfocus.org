NumFOCUS is pleased to announce `NumPy`_ as our newest fiscally sponsored project. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is open source, BSD-licensed and contains among other things:

	- a powerful N-dimensional array object
	- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
	- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
	- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
With the addition of NumPy, NumFOCUS now fiscally sponsors eleven different open source data science projects. To make a donation to support NumPy or any of NumFOCUSâ€™ other projects, `click here`_.
