We're thrilled to announce that the `2014 John Hunter Fellowship`_ has been
awarded to **Olga Botvinnik, UC San Diego**.  The focus of her Fellowship will
be to create open source software for the single-cell biology community, and to
pioneer data and code sharing within the single-cell and RNA biology communities.
She will take up this Fellowship in the second half of 2014, and collaborate
with her academic mentor Gene Yeo and software mentor C. Titus Brown.

The selection process was not an easy one - there were a number of high quality
applicants that we would have loved to be able to award a fellowship.
Honorary Mentions go to **Damien Irving (University of Melbourne)** 
and **Connie Gao (MIT)**. 

This first Numfocus Fellowship Program has gotten off to a promising start.
We're aiming to expand the program in the coming years to 5-10 fellowships each
year.
