Panel of Women in Tech speaking to a group of 60 HS girls from one of our outreach events.

**Student Feedback:**
“I liked getting to know and getting familiar with a new coding language.” 

“I really enjoyed the panel as it let me understand that I am not the only person who is conflicted with choosing a career.”

“Really good information, can really use it in my life. Nice to have real women talk about how it is used in everything!”


The `John Hunter Technology Fellowship`_ aiming to bridge the gap between academia and real-world, open-source scientific computing projects.
