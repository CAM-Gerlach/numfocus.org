NumFOCUS was formed in 2012 with the goal of "promoting the use of accessible and reproducible computing in science and technology."  The Foundation's work is largely centered around Python and its tools.  

Community involvement is critical to supporting NumFocus' projects and making Python more visible in the scientific and engineering community.
