**Purpose:** The John Hunter Technology Fellowship aims to bridge the gap
between academia and real-world, open-source scientific computing projects by
providing a capstone experience for individuals coming from a scientific
educational background.

**Description:** The program consists of a 6 month project-based training
program for postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students.  Fellows work
on scientific computing open source projects under the guidance of mentors who
are leading scientists and software engineers.  The aim of the Fellowship is to
enable Fellows to develop the skills needed to contribute to cutting-edge open
source software projects while at the same time advancing or supporting the
research program they and their mentor are involved in.

While proposals in any area of science and engineering are welcome, the
following areas are encouraged in particular: 

- Accessible and reproducible computing
- Enabling technology for open access publishing
- Infrastructural technology supporting open-source scientific software stacks
- Core open-source projects promoted by NumFOCUS

**Eligibility:** Eligible applicants are postdoctoral scientists or senior PhD
students, or have equivalent experience in physics, mathematics, engineering,
statistics, or a related science.  The program is open to applicants from any
nationality and can be performed at any university or institute world-wide
(US export laws permitting).

Application Deadline
--------------------
All applications are due May 15, 2014 by 11:59 p.m. Central Standard Time.

Award Information
-----------------
The Fellow receives an award of $33,000, which is meant to support the Fellow
for 6 months of full-time work as defined in the accepted Proposal.

The Fellowship can be started in the Jul 2014 - Jan 2015 time frame.

How to Apply
------------
Applicants must complete their application in collaboration with the
proposed mentor and host institution.
Submit applications to fellowships@numfocus.org, starting the subject line of
the email with "JH Fellowship".  The applicant should receive e-mail
verification within 48 hours stating the application has been received.
For additional information contact Numfocus by e-mail at:
fellowships@numfocus.org or by phone at: (+1) 512-222-5449.

Applications must include all of the following:

* Proposal Cover Page.  Should contain name, mailing address, email address,
  and phone number of both the applicant and the proposed mentor.  Plus the
  prosed start date for the fellowship.
* Proposal. Should contain a description of the proposed work, proposed
  scientific mentor and host institution, and anticipated educational value to
  fellow.
* Short summary of education, research, and work experience.
* Two letters of recommendation. 

Review Process
--------------
Numfocus is committed to ensuring a fair and open process for awarding
fellowships based on proposal quality, need, education, research, and work
experience.  A committee will review each application independently.

No applicant shall be denied consideration or appointment as a Numfocus
Technology Fellow on the grounds of race, creed, color, national origin, age,
or sex.

Award Notification
------------------
Applicants will be notified within 4 weeks after the deadline.

Numfocus publishes lists of Fellowship recipients on the website at
`<numfocus.org>`_.

Conditions of Award
-------------------
* The award is paid out via the Fellowship Office of the host institution.
* The award is meant for the Fellow.  No overhead or indirect institutional
  expenses must be deducted from the award.
* All publications resulting from work supported by the award should be
  freely available to the public, either by publishing in an Open Access journal
  or by posting on a well-recognized pre-print server (arXiv or similar).

Activity Report/Program Evaluation
----------------------------------
Fellows are required to submit a written report within 30 days of the
completion of the fellowship. The report should include information on any
related activities, accomplishments, employment, research collaboration, and
any other activities helpful in evaluating the impact of the fellowship as well
as the programâ€™s effectiveness in bridging the gap between academia and
real-world, open-source coding projects.


FAQ
---
**Would this fellowship apply to the life sciences as well?**

Yes. Any proposal that falls under "open-source scientific computing" is very
welcome. 

**Is the fellowship restricted to scientific Python?**

No.  While Numfocus is currently mostly focused on Python, proposals for
projects in Julia, R or other open source scientific computing languages /
environments are equally welcome.

**Can the proposed mentor come from industry?**

It is possible for both mentor and fellow to be in industry.  Constructions
with a fellow at an institute or university and a mentor from industry may also
be possible (and even provide additional value), however in that case support
within the host institute is also necessary.  Please discuss particular
situations with Numfocus.

**What makes a strong applicant? How much experience is required? And is it
more about the scientific value of the software?**

The ideal fellow would be a talented scientist/engineer who is also a great
developer, is new to contributing to an open source project, learns about and
enjoys contributing to open source scientific computing projects, has a big
impact during his fellowship, keeps contributing to OS scientific computing
projects afterwards, and builds on his fellowship in the next steps of his
career.

It is important that the fellowship has educational value to the fellow. It
shouldn't simply be funding to do things that he/she was already doing before.

**What disqualifies someone from applying?**

- Having obtained a PhD more than 4 years before the deadline.
- Not being able to work full-time (except for exceptional circumstances that
  have to be discussed with the board).
- Not being able to agree to the conditions of the award, like making
  publications freely available.

Too much experience doesn't disqualify as a rule (can't quantify "too"), but
there needs to be some educational component.

**Is it possible to spread the duration of the Fellowship over two summers, or
work half time for a year?**

We expect the Fellow to work for 6 months full time without a long
interruption.  Exceptions are possible but should be discussed with Numfocus at
the time of submitting the application.

**Can I apply if I haven't found a mentor and host institution yet?**

No.  The award is made to the Fellow, however the application
should be a joint effort by the Fellow and his/her proposed mentor and host
institution. 

**Is it expected that the proposed work will be undertaken at the
mentor's host institution, or is remote working also acceptable?**

Numfocus definitely has a strong preference for working at the host
institution. Whether remote working is acceptable under some
circumstances can be discussed with the Numfocus board.

**Is the award renewable?**

No.  The purpose of the Fellowship is largely educational; after 6 months the
Fellow is expected to have acquired the skills to contribute to scientific open
source projects independently.

**How many awards are made in 2014?**

Numfocus aims to scale up its Numfocus Technology Fellowship Program to 5-10
awards per year, funds permitting.  However, the May 2014 application
round is the first time that Numfocus makes an award.  The Program is starting
by making a single award in this round.

**How long is the proposal allowed to be?**

While there is no hard limit, we recommend that the proposal including cover
letter should not exceed 10 pages.

**The condition awards mention Open Access publishing, which is not free.  Can
you help with the publishing costs?**

Yes.  Numfocus aims to support Open Access publications that follow from work
done by Fellows.  For publishing in reputable Open Access journals up to $1500
per Fellow can be contributed; more in exceptional cases.  Please discuss this
topic with Numfocus directly.

**Who are the members of the review committee?**

The Numfocus board will be reviewing all proposals and make the final decision. 
Where needed the board may invite domain experts to review proposals.

**Who is John Hunter?**

John Hunter was the creator of Matplotlib and one of the founders of Numfocus.
