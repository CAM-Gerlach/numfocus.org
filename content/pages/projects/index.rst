NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be
defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide
variety of databases.

`SciPy`_
--------

SciPy is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It is
also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with
Python. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast
N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy
arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such
as routines for numerical integration and optimization.

`Matplotlib`_
--------------

2D plotting library for Python that produces high quality figures that can be
used in various hardcopy and interactive environments.  Matplolib is
compatible with Python scripts and the Python and IPython shells, web
application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.

`IPython`_
--------------

    :height: 75px

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a
full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as
possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written
entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.



Other Projects
==============

`Cython`_
-------------

    :alt: Cython logo
    :height: 75px

Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming
language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It
makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself. 


`pandas`_
-------------

    :height: 75px

pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance,
easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming
language.


`PyTables`_
---------------

    :alt: PyTables logo
    :height: 75px

PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and designed to
efficiently and easily cope with extremely large amounts of data. PyTables is
built on top of the HDF5 library, using the Python language and the NumPy
package. It features a Pythonic interface combined with C / Cython extensions
for the performance-critical parts of the code.  This makes it a fast, yet
extremely easy to use tool for very large amounts of data.

`inSCIght`_ is a podcast that focuses on scientific computing in all of its
various forms. We have four panelists engage head-to-head on poignant and
interesting topics. The panelists are drawn from all across the scientific
computing community.  From embedded systems experts to very high level language
gurus, from biologists to nuclear engineers, the hosts of inSCIght use
computers to solve science and engineering problems everyday. This podcast
throws people, ideas, and opinions into an audio-blender hoping to educate and
entice each other and the world.  `http://inscight.org`_
