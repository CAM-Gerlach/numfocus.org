Jennifer Klay is an Associate Professor of Physics at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  She has worked with big data at the CERN Large Hadron Collider’s ALICE experiment for 14 years, unlocking the secrets of the early Universe by colliding heavy nuclei at the highest energies available in the lab.  She has managed several large scientific software projects in nuclear and particle physics experiments and is the Executive Council Chairperson for the Neutron Induced Fission Fragment Tracking Experiment (NIFFTE) Collaboration.  Over the past several years she developed an introductory computational science course using the IPython notebook to teach data analysis and numerical methods for students in the physical sciences.  She loves to code and advocates computer software education for all as an essential 21st century technical skill.



Didrik Pinte (Treasurer)

Didrik Pinte has had a mixed career between academia
and the private sector. As a researcher, he focused his work on large scale
water allocation problems during 4 years at UCL, Belgium. After another 5 years
running his own consulting company in the field of environmental data
management systems, mostly based on Python, he joined Enthought. He is now
running the European operations of Enthought out of Cambridge, UK.

Andy Terrel received his PhD in computer science at the University of Chicago
in 2010. He is currently the Chief Technology Officer at Fashion Metric.  His major emphasis of research
has been on the automation of numerical methods on high performance computing
resources. To this end, he has provided numerous contributions to a wide
variety of open source projects, including the popular FEniCS project and
SymPy.

Dr. Terrel has held roles at universities, government laboratories, and several
companies.  In all of these roles, Dr. Terrel has been an expert in HPC
computing as well as an advocate for the open source software movement.  Dr.
Terrel has served as chair and organizer of many scientific computing
conferences including SciPy Conference, FEniCS Conference, HPC^3, and
