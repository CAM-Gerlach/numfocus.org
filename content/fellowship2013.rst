The purpose of the Numfocus Technology Fellowship Program is to bridge the gap
between academia and real-world, open-source coding projects by providing a
capstone experience for individuals coming from a scientific educational
background.

Program Description
-------------------
The program consists of a 3-18 month project-based training program for
postdoctoral scientists. Fellows work on actual coding projects under the
guidance of mentors who are leading scientists and software engineers.
Collaboration with these top industry developers enables scientists to learn
specific skills needed to contribute to cutting-edge open-source software.
