Founded by the creators of NumPy, SciPy, and Chaco, Continuum offers
Python-based tools and consulting services for the analysis, management
and visualization of big data. Continuum’s premier Python distribution,
Anaconda, performs high-performance, large data analysis, including
statistics, machine learning, and distributed computing. Wakari,
Continuum’s newest product, is an online cloud-based Python analytics
environment for easy sharing of code, visualizations, IPython Notebooks,
data sets and derived data products. Cloud-hosted or installed
internally, Wakari allows users to harness Continuum’s full product set,
including Anaconda and enterprise-supported Python, from their browsers.
