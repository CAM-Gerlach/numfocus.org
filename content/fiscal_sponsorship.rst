In our efforts to promote and support high-level languages, reproducible
scientific research and open-source development, NumFOCUS offers a Fiscal
Sponsorship program.  The Fiscal Sponsorship program is a way for for donors to
financially contribute toward the progress of a NumFOCUS affiliated project
while also receiving benefits of contributing to 501(c)3 charity. 

NumFOCUS offers two models of Fiscal Sponsorship - *Grantor-Grantee* and
*Comprehensive*.  In both models, the project must act to further the
tax-exempt purposes of NumFOCUS according to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code as being organized and operated exclusively for one or more
purposes including charitable, educational, and scientific.

**Grantor-Grantee model**: The fiscally sponsored project does not become a
program belonging to the sponsor (as is the case with Comprehensive Sponsorship
below), but is a separate entity responsible for managing its own tax reporting
and liability issues. In addition, the sponsor does not maintain ownership of
any part of the results of the projectâ€™s work. The sponsor simply assures
itself that the project will use the grant funds received to accomplish the
ends described in the grant proposal and that these will further the tax-exempt
purposes of NumFOCUS. 

**Comprehensive model**: The fiscally sponsored project becomes a program of
the fiscal sponsor and is a fully integrated part of the fiscal sponsor who
maintains all legal and fiduciary responsibility for the sponsored project, its
employees and activities.  Any work product is available to the public or to
the charitable sector. The fiscal sponsor assures funders that the purposes and
any restrictions of all grants and/or contributions will be met and these will
further the tax-exempt purposes of NumFOCUS.

The Grantor-Grantee Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement (FSA) document are available
as `pdf for preview`_ and as `LaTeX template`_.
The Comprehensive FSA will be published in the near future.  Please look over
our Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement and let us know if you have questions or would
like additional information by contacting us at: `info@numfocus.org`_.
