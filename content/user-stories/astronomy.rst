On 28 March, NASA’s Swift satellite \ `observed a flash of gamma rays
brighter than anything astronomers had seen before`_. It soon became
evident that the event wasn’t a typical gamma ray burst, an emission of
high-energy radiation that often accompanies a supernova explosion. The
flash didn’t die out but was sustained for weeks, and although it has
faded in intensity, it is still going strong 2½ months later. Two papers
published online today in *Science* provide an explanation for this
luminous surprise. The flare is in fact `a high-energy jet of
radiation`_ produced by a star falling into a black hole at the center
of a galaxy 4 billion light-years away. The reason the flare is so
bright is that the jet is pointed straight in the direction of Earth.
And it’s sustained because `the black hole is consuming the star
gradually`_. “That’s because as the black hole rips the star apart, the
mass swirls around like water going down a drain, and this swirling
process releases a lot of energy,” says Joshua Bloom, an astronomer at
the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of one of the
two papers. Bloom expects the flare to fade out over the next year.
