Scientists map the "current" of mountain lions moving between mountain ranges. Blue shows areas of low current density, which are expected to have low densities of dispersing mountain lions; yellow designates movement bottlenecks, which are most vulnerable to habitat destruction. Destroying high-flow habitat can isolate populations and endanger their survival. \

\ `PyAMG`_\  is an open-source numerical package of multigrid and Krylov
solvers for sparse matrices in Python.  One of the biggest users of
PyAMG is \ `Circuitscape`_. This open-source software program borrows
algorithms from electronic circuit theory to predict patterns of
movement, gene flow, and genetic differentiation among plant and animal
populations in heterogeneous landscapes.  Circuit theory complements
least-cost path approaches because it considers effects of all possible
pathways across a landscape simultaneously.

\ `Circuitscape`_\  was written by \ `Brad McRae`_ and `Viral Shah`_\ . 
Brad is an Ecologist with the `The Nature Conservancy`_ in Seattle.  He
works on habitat connectivity conservation, climate change, and
landscape genetics.  Viral is a Senior Scientist with `Interactive
Supercomputing`_ and a Visiting Scientist at the `University of
California, Santa Barbara. `_\ He develops systems for scientific
computing for work and for fun.
