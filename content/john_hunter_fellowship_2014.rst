**Purpose:** The John Hunter Technology Fellowship aims to bridge the gap
between academia and real-world, open-source scientific computing projects by
providing a capstone experience for individuals coming from a scientific
educational background.

**Description:** The program consists of a 6 month project-based training
program for postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students.  Fellows work
on scientific computing open source projects under the guidance of mentors who
are leading scientists and software engineers.  The aim of the Fellowship is to
enable Fellows to develop the skills needed to contribute to cutting-edge open
source software projects while at the same time advancing or supporting the
research program they and their mentor are involved in.

While proposals in any area of science and engineering are welcome, the
following areas are encouraged in particular: 

- Accessible and reproducible computing
- Enabling technology for open access publishing
- Infrastructural technology supporting open-source scientific software stacks
- Core open-source projects promoted by NumFOCUS

**Eligibility:** Eligible applicants are postdoctoral scientists or senior PhD
students, or have equivalent experience in physics, mathematics, engineering,
statistics, or a related science.  The program is open to applicants from any
nationality and can be performed at any university or institute world-wide
(US export laws permitting).

FAQ
---
**How long is the proposal allowed to be?**

While there is no hard limit, we recommend that the proposal including cover
letter should not exceed 10 pages.

**Is it possible to spread the duration of the Fellowship over two summers, or
work half time for a year?**

We expect the Fellow to work for 6 months full time without a long
interruption.  Exceptions are possible but should be discussed with Numfocus at
the time of submitting the application.

**Can I apply if I haven't found a mentor and host institution yet?**

No.  The award is made to the Fellow, however the application
should be a joint effort by the Fellow and his/her proposed mentor and host
institution. 

**Is the award renewable?**

No.  The purpose of the Fellowship is largely educational; after 6 months the
Fellow is expected to have acquired the skills to contribute to scientific open
source projects independently.

**How many awards are made in 2014?**

Numfocus aims to scale up its Numfocus Technology Fellowship Program to 5-10
awards per year, funds permitting.  However, the May 2014 application
round is the first time that Numfocus makes an award.  The Program is starting
by making a single award in this round.

**The condition awards mention Open Access publishing, which is not free.  Can
you help with the publishing costs?**

Yes.  Numfocus aims to support Open Access publications that follow from work
done by Fellows.  For publishing in reputable Open Access journals up to $1500
per Fellow can be contributed; more in exceptional cases.  Please discuss this
topic with Numfocus directly.

**Who is John Hunter?**

John Hunter was the creator of Matplotlib and one of the founders of Numfocus.
