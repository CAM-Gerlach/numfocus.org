Applications are now being accepted for the NumFOCUS Technology Fellowship.
This educational program furthers our mission, as a public charity, to promote
the use of accessible and reproducible computing in science and open-source
technology.

The purpose of the NumFOCUS Technology Fellowship is to bridge the gap between
academia and real-world, open-source coding projects by providing a capstone
experience for individuals coming from a scientific educational background.

The program consists of a 3-18 month project-based training program for
postdoctoral scientists. Fellows work on actual coding projects under the
guidance of mentors who are leading scientists and software engineers.
Collaboration with these top industry developers enables scientists to learn
specific skills needed to contribute to cutting-edge open-source software.

The full description of the fellowship can be found here_.
