Donate to NumFOCUS
------------------

NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 nonprofit in the United States. Your tax deductible
donations go towards funding the following activities:

- Work with domain-specific organizations

Fiscal Sponsorship
------------------
In our efforts to promote and support high-level languages, reproducible
scientific research and open-source development, NumFOCUS offers a Fiscal
Sponsorship program.  The Fiscal Sponsorship program is a way for for donors to
financially contribute toward the progress of a NumFOCS affilaited project
while also receiving benefits of contributing to 501(c)3 charity.  In our
Fiscal Sponsorship program, the nonexempt project must act so as to further the
exempt purposes of NumFOCUS.

    Fiscal Sponsorship is a an arrangement between a 501(c)(3) public charity
    and a project (that does not have that tax status) in which, typically, the
    charity receives and expends funds to advance the charitable work of the
    project while retaining discretion and control over the funds.
