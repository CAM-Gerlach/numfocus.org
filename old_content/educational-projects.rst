**inSCIght** is a podcast that focuses on scientific computing in all of
its various forms. We have four panelists engage head-to-head on
poignant and interesting topics. The panelists are drawn from all across
the scientific computing community.  From embedded systems experts to
very high level language gurus, from biologists to nuclear engineers,
the hosts of inSCIght use computers to solve science and engineering
problems everyday. This podcast throws people, ideas, and opinions into
an audio-blender hoping to educate and entice each other and the world.

Our mission is to help scientists be more productive by teaching them
basic computing skills. Our approach combines short, intensive workshops
with self-paced online instruction. The benefits are more reliable
results and higher productivity: a day a week is common, and a ten-fold
improvement isn’t rare.  For more information check out our blog
