Circuitscape Protects Endangered Species Using PyAMG

Scientists map the "current" of mountain lions moving between mountain ranges. Blue shows areas of low current density, which are expected to have low densities of dispersing mountain lions; yellow designates movement bottlenecks, which are most vulnerable to habitat destruction. Destroying high-flow habitat can isolate populations and endanger their survival. \ *

\ `PyAMG`_\  is an open-source numerical package of multigrid and Krylov
solvers for sparse matrices in Python.  One of the biggest users of
PyAMG is \ `Circuitscape`_. This open-source software program borrows
algorithms from electronic circuit theory to predict patterns of
movement, gene flow, and genetic differentiation among plant and animal
populations in heterogeneous landscapes.  Circuit theory complements
least-cost path approaches because it considers effects of all possible
pathways across a landscape simultaneously.

\ `Circuitscape`_\  was written by \ `Brad McRae`_ and `Viral Shah`_\ . 
Brad is an Ecologist with the `The Nature Conservancy`_ in Seattle.  He
works on habitat connectivity conservation, climate change, and
landscape genetics.  Viral is a Senior Scientist with `Interactive
Supercomputing`_ and a Visiting Scientist at the `University of
California, Santa Barbara. `_\ He develops systems for scientific
computing for work and for fun.

\ **Python in Astronomy**\

On 28 March, NASA’s Swift satellite \ `observed a flash of gamma rays
brighter than anything astronomers had seen before`_. It soon became
evident that the event wasn’t a typical gamma ray burst, an emission of
high-energy radiation that often accompanies a supernova explosion. The
flash didn’t die out but was sustained for weeks, and although it has
faded in intensity, it is still going strong 2½ months later. Two papers
published online today in \ *Science* provide an explanation for this
luminous surprise. The flare is in fact \ `a high-energy jet of
radiation`_ produced by a star falling into a black hole at the center
of a galaxy 4 billion light-years away. The reason the flare is so
bright is that the jet is pointed straight in the direction of Earth.
And it’s sustained because\ `the black hole is consuming the star
gradually`_. “That’s because as the black hole rips the star apart, the
mass swirls around like water going down a drain, and this swirling
process releases a lot of energy,” says Joshua Bloom, an astronomer at
the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of one of the
two papers. Bloom expects the flare to fade out over the next year.

\ **Tokyo SciPy**\ 
-------------------

`|image2|`_

Chairman of NumFOCUS' Board of Director's,Travis Oliphant, spoke at the
March meeting of Tokyo SciPy via live webcast.  Topics he covered
included the history of \ `SciPy`_, where \ `NumPy `_\ should go next,
and Numba.  Questions were asked regarding sparse matrix integration
with NumPy, and packaging.

Tokyo SciPy member, Syoyo, gave Travis the link to his code for
simulating smoke,  `http://code.google.com/p/smoke3d/`_.  Perhaps at
some point, Syoyo will be able to make that code fast using Python.

Despite a late night, due to the fourteen hour time difference between
Austin and Tokyo, Travis spoke for over an hour.  He later stated, “…it
was nice to see that SciPy and NumPy have a user community in Japan.”
