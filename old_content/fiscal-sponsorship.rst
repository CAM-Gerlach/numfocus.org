In our efforts to promote and support high-level languages, reproducible scientific research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and open-source development, we are proud to announce that our Fiscal Sponsorship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

program is now underway.

*Fiscal Sponsorship is a an arrangement between a 501(c)(3) public
charity and a project (that does not have that tax status) in which,
typically, the charity receives and expends funds to advance the
charitable work of the project while retaining discretion and control
over the funds.*          -Eric Gorovitz, associate, Adler & Colvin

In our Fiscal Sponsorship program, the nonexempt project must act so as
to further the exempt purposes of NumFOCUS.

Please look over our Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement and let us know if you
have questions or would like additional information by contacting us at:
